## Overview

The process of licence plate detection involves locating the area of the car that is likely to have the number plate. Identification is the process of recognising the values on the licence plate. In order to identify a licence plate from an input image of an automobile, licence plate detection and recognition technology use computer vision. There are numerous uses for this technology. It is used to identify vehicles that are infringing traffic laws on roads. In terms of security, it's utilised to record the license plate numbers of vehicles entering and leaving particular locations. It is used in parking lots to record the plate numbers of the parked cars. Its uses are countless, and the list is virtually endless. 

Security has elevated to the top of any organization's list of worries in the modern world, and automation of such security is crucial. Many of the present-day solutions, which frequently depend on a variety of limitations, are still not reliable in real-world settings. 

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains 433 images with bounding box annotations of the car license plates within the image. Annotations are provided in the PASCAL VOC format.
